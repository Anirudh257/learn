<h3 align="center"> First Step towards programming </h3>
This course is specifically designed for beginners who are interested to explore the programming world.  

Before proceeding any further, I would want to make few this clearer. 
 - Programming like any other thing in this world is intimidating, dedication and perseverance is the only way for you to succeed. 
 - A computer is nothing but a dumb machine, it does whatever you program it to do for how many ever times you want it to do.

I personally believe that understanding these things are the only prerequisites for this curriculum. This is the first step towards programming. Happy Coding.
