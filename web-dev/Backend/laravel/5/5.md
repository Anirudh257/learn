## Final project

You are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you can *use* your knowledge to solve a real world problem.

After you've gotten through all of Core Laravel and the parts of Advanced Laravel relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, the project will *validate* and *consolidate* your knowledge.
